            I am Jinjia, aspiring to be a coder and working on my first ever personal website. My journey was
            kickstarted when I took a introductory class to computer science with Python as the "language" of 
            instruction. One problem, in particular, really introduced me to the highs and lows of programming. </p>

            <img class ="python" src = "images/codingquestion1.png">
            <img class = "python" src = "images/codinganswer1.png">
            </p>

            <p class = "text-justify">We had just started learning about loops, iterations and recursions, and 
            were taught that for every recursion, there was a way to code the same algorithm in iteration. The 
            algorithm for this mosaic seemed short and sweet, but the hours and fatigue I fought through to complete
            this was unforgettable. I remembered coding through the night, and even thinking of the solution while 
            I was trying to fall asleep! Eventually, I was still in deep thought and decided to give sleep a miss, 
            and finally completing it at dawn. Looking back, this was one of those nights when I decided that I should 
            make coding a part of my life. (Of course, sleeping might have been a better option. It actually refreshes
            one's mind and thus, I could have reached the solution in shorter time!)
            </p>

            <p class = "text-justify">Since then, I looked for online resources to learn other languages on my own. 
            Tackling front-end web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is my current hustle, and this website is the fruit
            of my learning. You can find projects that I have been working on from the "Projects" tab. The "Life" tab consists of 
            details about my personal life, including a website (still in progress) that covers the backpacking trip I made in 2017 to China & Korea.
