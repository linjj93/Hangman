        <h1>Hello World.</h1>
        <p>
        I am Jinjia, aspiring to be a coder and working on my first ever personal website. My journey was
        kickstarted when I took a introductory class to computer science with Python as the "language" of
        instruction. One problem, in particular, really introduced me to the highs and lows of programming. </p>

          <img src = "images/codinganswer1.png">
        </div>


        <p>We had just started learning about loops, iterations and recursions, and
        were taught that for every recursion, there was a way to code the same algorithm in iteration. The
        algorithm for this mosaic seemed short and sweet, but the hours and fatigue I fought through to complete
        this was unforgettable. I remembered coding through the night, and even thinking of the solution while
        I was trying to fall asleep! Eventually, I was still in deep thought and decided to give sleep a miss,
        and finally completing it at dawn. Looking back, this was one of those nights when I decided that I should
        make coding a part of my life. (Of course, I could have reached the solution in shorter time if I had rested with a refreshed mind!)
        </p>

        <p>Since then, I looked for online resources to learn other languages on my own.
        Tackling front-end web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript is my current hustle, and this website is the fruit
        of my learning. You can find projects that I have been working on from the "Projects" tab. The "Life" tab consists of
        details about my personal life, including a website (still in progress) that covers the backpacking trip I made in 2017 to China & Korea.
