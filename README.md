This will be my GitHub page.

It will consist of:

1) My Resume for applying jobs
2) Various Projects I am working on, which include:
  - a hangman game (ongoing)
  - an expenditure tracker (planned)
  - tic-tac-toe (followed a tutorial, going to code one by myself from scratch)
  - an app to help users (individuals or in groups) decide what to eat based on their preferences
